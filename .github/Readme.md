# Homework 3 (Lab) - Creating Links

For this homework youâ€™ll work on the sample Comp 484  site to create page navigation, link to external sites, and use fragment identifiers to link to sections within a site.

1. Build page navigation
    1.	Applies to: ***all pages***
    2.	Using document-relative links, enhance the list at the top of the document so that it links to the appropriate pages in the reference site. Be sure to add meaningful descriptions to each link.

2. Link to external sites
    1.	Applies to: `links.htm`
    2.	In the footer, locate the first reference to CSUN
    3. Create a link that links that text to the actual [CSUN](csun.edu) site.
    4. Modify the link so that the site opens in a new tab or window
    5. Remember to add descriptive text for the link
    6. Browse to Twitter and find the profile page for [@csunorthridge](https://x.com/csunorthridge), copy its URL
    7. Back in the `footer`, add a link to new text that says "follow us on Twitter" that links to the [@csunorthridge](https://x.com/csunorthridge) profile

3.	Link to internal sections
    1.	Applies to: `reference.htm`, `syntax.htm`
    2.	In the `reference.htm` page, find the text in the first paragraph that refers to the table of named character entities
    3. Create a link around that text that jumps to the table at the bottom of the page. Keep in mind that you'll need to modify the table as well to make this work.
    4. Open the `syntax.htm` page. 
    5. At the bottom of the page, locate the text in the last paragraph that mentions the table of named character entities on the reference page.
    6. Create a link around that text that navigates to the reference page and jumps to that specific section.
